## About Us

![About1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hillsandoceans/hillsandoceansblog/main/public/images/emosson1.jpeg)
Hello there!

Welcome to our little space, where we bring you stories from places and people!
We are Vaibhavi and Suyash, PhD students in Physics, based in Switzerland.

The last few months of 2023 marked the beginning of our journey of exploration. Since then, we have ventured on some beautiful hikes in Switzerland, taken weekend trips to several European cities, tried a variety of cuisines, and met some wonderful people along the way.
This is our way of sharing it all with youâ€” the hikes, nature, cities, and stories!

Love,

Suyash and Vaibhavi
